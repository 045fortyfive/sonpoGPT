# Ralph Progress Log
Started: 2025-01-15

## Codebase Patterns

Add reusable patterns here as you discover them. These will be read first in each iteration.

Examples:
- Migrations: Use IF NOT EXISTS
- React: useRef<Timeout | null>(null)
- Next.js: Server actions should be in app/actions.ts
- TypeScript: Export types from types.ts

## Key Files

Important files to reference:
- `src/app/layout.tsx` - Root layout
- `src/app/page.tsx` - Home page
- `AGENTS.md` - Project-wide learnings
- `.cursorrules` - Cursor agent rules
- `gemini.md` - Gemini agent rules

---

## Session Log

Ralph will append learnings here after each story completion.
